    <p>Combatting Six Major Vector-Borne Diseases Across India</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Target Group (To Whom It Applies)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>People living in endemic and high-risk areas across India</li>
      <li>Rural, tribal, and urban slum populations</li>
      <li>Pregnant women, children, and individuals with weak immunity</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No formal eligibility criteria â€” applies to all citizens in endemic zones</li>
      <li>Focus on vulnerable and high-exposure groups</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction to the Scheme</h2>
    <p>The NVBDCP is the umbrella program of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for the prevention and control of six major vector-borne diseases: Malaria, Dengue, Lymphatic Filariasis, Kala-azar, Chikungunya, and Japanese Encephalitis. It was launched by merging various disease-specific programs in 2003 to create a unified response mechanism for vector control in India.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What It Contains (Benefits Offered)</h2>
    <h3>Key Interventions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Free early diagnosis and complete treatment of vector-borne diseases</li>
      <li>Distribution of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) and Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs)</li>
      <li>Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), fogging operations, and larval control activities</li>
      <li>Intensive Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) and Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) campaigns</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Application Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No formal application process is required</li>
      <li>Beneficiaries are reached through PHCs, CHCs, ASHA workers, and mobile health teams</li>
      <li>Preventive tools and treatments are provided free of cost in affected regions</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Duration & Timeline</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Established in 2003 through integration of disease-specific national programmes</li>
      <li>Ongoing, with intensified action during seasonal peaks and outbreaks</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Pros & Limitations</h2>
    <h3>Strengths:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Holistic coverage of six major diseases under one umbrella</li>
      <li>Free diagnosis, treatment, and vector control tools for affected populations</li>
      <li>Robust surveillance systems and timely outbreak response mechanisms</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Weaknesses:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Challenges in urban slum reach and vector control</li>
      <li>Dependence on seasonal staff and timely supply logistics</li>
      <li>Emerging vector resistance to insecticides in some regions</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Marked decline in malaria and kala-azar cases in several states</li>
      <li>Effective reduction in mosquito-borne disease burden through LLIN and IRS campaigns</li>
      <li>Strengthened outbreak monitoring and quick containment of epidemics</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>BONUS: Strategic Insight</h2>
    <p>NVBDCP represents an integrated, proactive public health strategy tackling multiple diseases with shared vectors. Its strength lies in combining surveillance, prevention, and treatment with widespread community involvement. Digital tools and real-time data reporting can further boost its impact and equity in disease control.</p>
