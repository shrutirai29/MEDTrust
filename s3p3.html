    <p>The National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP) is a centrally sponsored scheme under the National Health Mission. Originally launched as the National Leprosy Control Programme in 1955, it was rebranded as NLEP in 1983 to emphasize eradication. The program focuses on interrupting transmission, ensuring early detection, and providing free treatment and rehabilitation services. The vision includes eliminating stigma and achieving “Zero Leprosy.”</p>

      <li>Patients can directly visit government facilities for diagnosis and treatment</li>
      <li>Active surveillance through health workers, especially ASHAs, and routine screening in endemic areas</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Duration & Timeline</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1955: Launched as National Leprosy Control Programme</li>
      <li>1983: Renamed as National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP)</li>
      <li>2005: India declared leprosy eliminated as a public health problem (less than 1 case per 10,000 population)</li>
      <li>2023–2027: Strategic plan launched to achieve Zero Leprosy by 2027</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Pros & Limitations</h2>
    <h3>Strengths:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Universal free access to high-quality diagnosis and care</li>
      <li>Strong community-based interventions through ASHAs and health workers</li>
      <li>Integration with primary healthcare system and international support</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Challenges:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Persistent stigma and fear hinder self-reporting</li>
      <li>Underreporting and missed cases in remote or marginalized communities</li>
      <li>Access gaps for reconstructive surgery and disability services in some areas</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>
    <p>Although India achieved leprosy elimination status in 2005, over 100,000 new cases are still detected annually, highlighting the need for continued efforts. The program has significantly reduced visible deformities through early detection. ASHA workers have been instrumental in promoting awareness and supporting case detection at the grassroots level. Monitoring indicators now guide targeted interventions, making the program increasingly data-driven.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>BONUS: Strategic Vision 2023–2027</h2>
    <p>The Ministry of Health has laid out an ambitious roadmap to eliminate leprosy transmission entirely by 2027. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Zero transmission and disability through early detection</li>
      <li>Integrated case management with improved DPMR services</li>
      <li>Community sensitization and anti-stigma campaigns</li>
      <li>Leveraging technology for real-time data collection and response</li>
