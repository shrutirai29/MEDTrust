                        <h2>Sleep: The Brain’s Secret Night Shift</h2>
                        <p>Ever wondered what your brain is up to while you're fast asleep?
                            Is it just idling away, like when you're binge-watching TV? Not even close! In fact, your brain is more active during sleep than during a mindless TV marathon. But why? What's it actually doing?
                            Well, while you're off dreaming, your brain is busy consolidating memories, processing the day’s information, and even repairing itself.

                            So, here's the real question: Who's really getting the rest—you, or your brain</p>

                        <p>When we think of snake venom, the first thing that comes to mind is danger—a deadly substance capable of shutting down nervous systems, destroying tissues, and ending lives within minutes. But what if I told you that this same venom, often feared and avoided, is now being harnessed as a powerful tool in modern medicine?</p>
