    <h1>Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP)</h1>
    <p>India's First Line of Defense Against Epidemics</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Target Group (To Whom It Applies)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Entire population of India, particularly vulnerable groups in rural and urban slums.</li>
      <li>Healthcare providers, public health authorities, surveillance officers, and labs.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2>

      <li>No specific eligibility — surveillance covers all districts and disease-prone areas.</li>
      <li>Healthcare providers and institutions are responsible for reporting notifiable diseases.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction to the Scheme</h2>
    <p>The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) was launched in 2004 to strengthen disease surveillance in India. It aims to detect and respond to outbreaks rapidly through IT-enabled systems and trained healthcare personnel. It plays a vital role in pandemic preparedness and monitoring public health threats.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What It Contains (Benefits Offered)</h2>
    <h3>Core Features:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Weekly surveillance data collection and outbreak alerts.</li>
      <li>Three-tier reporting system (S, P, L forms) for comprehensive tracking.</li>
      <li>Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) for immediate investigation and control.</li>
      <li>Media scanning and verification cell (MSVC) for early warning from news sources.</li>
      <li>Strengthened labs and trained staff for diagnosis and management.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Pros & Limitations</h2>
    <h3>Strengths:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Timely outbreak detection and control</li>
      <li>Improved national health monitoring and infrastructure</li>
      <li>Supports India’s obligations under International Health Regulations (IHR)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Weaknesses:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reporting inconsistencies across states</li>
      <li>Under-reporting and lack of trained manpower in remote areas</li>
      <li>Delays in lab confirmations in some districts</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Outbreak Tracking:</strong> Over 1,700 outbreaks reported annually in recent years.</li>
      <li><strong>Common Diseases Detected:</strong> Measles, Chickenpox, Food Poisoning, Chikungunya, ADD.</li>
      <li><strong>Media Alerts:</strong> Over 4,800 media alerts tracked (till Feb 2018) — diarrhea, dengue, measles being frequent alerts.</li>
