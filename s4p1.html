    <p>The National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP) was launched in 2007–08 under the 11th Five-Year Plan to tackle the rising health burden of tobacco consumption. It supports enforcement of the <strong>Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003</strong>, aligns with the <strong>WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC)</strong>, and aims to reduce tobacco use through public awareness, legislation, and cessation support. NTCP was further strengthened after the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) 2009–10 and now integrates with the National Health Mission (NHM).</p>

      <li>Multi-sectoral collaboration for awareness and enforcement</li>
      <li>Reduced tobacco usage trends as per GATS-2 (8.1 million fewer users)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Challenges:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Poor enforcement in rural and peri-urban areas</li>
      <li>Deep-rooted social acceptance of tobacco in some communities</li>
      <li>Inconsistent availability of cessation services</li>
      <li>Coordination gaps across departments</li>
      <li>Opposition from informal tobacco industry and lobbyists</li>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>
    <p>NTCP has been successful in expanding awareness and services across India. GATS-2 reported a significant drop in tobacco use. Districts now have functional cessation services, and public education on tobacco hazards has increased. Yet, stronger enforcement and service delivery are required to reach underserved populations and further reduce tobacco dependency.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>BONUS: Strategic Insight</h2>
    <p>NTCP is a vital initiative combining law enforcement, medical support, and community education. With proper execution and coordination, it can drastically reduce India’s tobacco burden and related health costs. Greater integration with primary health and school systems will help build a sustainable tobacco-free culture.</p>
