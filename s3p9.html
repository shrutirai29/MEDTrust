    <h1>National Programme on AMR Containment</h1>
    <p>Combating Antimicrobial Resistance Across Human, Animal, and Environmental Health</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Target Group (To Whom It Applies)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>General public – to reduce AMR-related health risks</li>
      <li>Healthcare professionals – for improved prescription practices and infection control</li>
      <li>Microbiology laboratories – for surveillance and diagnostics</li>
      <li>Policy makers – to inform antibiotic regulation and planning</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Public and government-supported medical institutions and labs</li>
      <li>Medical colleges and research centers participating in AMR surveillance</li>
      <li>State-level health authorities and infection control units</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction to the Programme</h2>
    <p>Launched in 2012 under the 12th Five Year Plan, the National Programme on AMR Containment addresses the urgent and escalating problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in India. It is implemented by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), aiming to build a comprehensive, laboratory-based surveillance system, promote rational antibiotic use, and strengthen infection prevention and control.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What It Contains (Strategies & Benefits)</h2>

    <h3>Core Strategies:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Surveillance:</strong> Track resistance in key bacterial pathogens using WHONET software.</li>
      <li><strong>Stewardship:</strong> Promote rational antibiotic use through treatment guidelines and hospital interventions.</li>
      <li><strong>Laboratory Strengthening:</strong> Train and equip microbiology labs to improve diagnostic capability.</li>
      <li><strong>Infection Control:</strong> Implement National IPC Guidelines to reduce healthcare-associated infections.</li>
      <li><strong>Capacity Building:</strong> Onsite mentoring, EQAS (External Quality Assessment Scheme), and virtual training modules.</li>
      <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Public education campaigns to discourage misuse of antibiotics.</li>
      <li><strong>Global Reporting:</strong> Share Indian AMR data with WHO’s GLASS (Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Benefits:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved evidence for policy and action</li>
      <li>Enhanced lab infrastructure for early detection</li>
      <li>Better-informed prescribers and regulated antibiotic usage</li>
      <li>Awareness for behavioral change at the community level</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Funding & Implementing Agency</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Funded by:</strong> Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India</li>
      <li><strong>Implemented by:</strong> National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC)</li>
      <li><strong>Supported by:</strong> WHO Country Office India, ICMR, and other global collaborators</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Application Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No direct public application; participation is institutional</li>
      <li>State and medical institutions can be inducted through NCDC coordination</li>
      <li>Training, protocols, and technical support provided by central and regional units</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Duration & Timeline</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Launched in 2012</li>
      <li>Expanded across 26 States/UTs</li>
      <li>40+ labs part of NARS-Net (National AMR Surveillance Network)</li>
      <li>Ongoing integration into One Health framework</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Pros & Limitations</h2>

    <h3>Strengths:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>First nationally coordinated effort on AMR</li>
      <li>Generated AMR surveillance data across pathogens and regions</li>
      <li>Contributed to development of National Treatment Guidelines</li>
      <li>Facilitated global cooperation through GLASS reporting</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenges:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Infrastructure and staffing gaps across labs</li>
      <li>Weak AMR data integration from the private sector</li>
      <li>Over-the-counter sale of antibiotics remains a concern</li>
      <li>Lack of uniform standards in data collection and reporting</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>
    <p>Through this programme, India has taken significant steps toward AMR containment by building a foundational surveillance system and raising awareness. It has laid the groundwork for evidence-based interventions in public hospitals and is gradually expanding into private and veterinary sectors for a holistic One Health approach.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>BONUS: Strategic Insight</h2>
    <p>AMR threatens the very foundation of modern medicine. By focusing on surveillance, stewardship, and infection control, this programme builds India’s resilience against future health crises. Strengthening this initiative through cross-sector partnerships can lead to sustainable antibiotic usage practices across the country.</p>
